\textbf{Further features in R}


\fbox{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
There exist a number of packages that illustrate interactively the central limit theorem or the law of large numbers, that can be useful
to have an intuition on those theorems:

\begin{itemize}
\item Package \pkg{animation} has \fun{clt.ani} and \fun{lln.ani} 
\item Package \pkg{TeachingDemos} has \fun{clt.examp} 
\item Package \pkg{ResearchMethods} has \fun{cltDemo} 
\end{itemize}

In addition, package \pkg{ConvergenceConcepts}, described in the R journal $1/2$ 2009 \emph{enables one 
to investigate graphically the four classical modes of convergence of a sequence of random
variables: convergence almost surely, convergence in probability, convergence in law and convergence in r-th mean.} (\citet{Micheaux2009})
